# Easy-Y
## A canceled program for making tween animations

`app.py` contains the GUI framework
`lib/shapetypes.py` has an example tween in it.
`CTkXYFrame` was code created by [Akascape](https://github.io/Akascape)
`Spinbox` and `customtkinter` was code created by [TomSchimansky](https://github.io/TomSchimansky)

This was canceled due to frame rate issues inherent to using tkinter with CPython. Any optimization edits would be greatly appreciated, but I myself will not touch this project for the forseeable future.
